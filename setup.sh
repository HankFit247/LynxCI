# This script will setup the host OS, install all dependencies for Lynx and then execute the install
# script after a short wait time of 15 minutes. Some hosting vendors might require a manual reboot
# (i.e. HostBRZ) after the whole installation is complete.

# To get started, log into your VPS or Pi, and as root copy and paste the following line.

# wget -qO - https://test-explorer.getlynx.io/setup.sh | bash

# This will start the intallation. You can now close the session window in your termial or putty
# window. The script will run in the background without need for human interaction. Depending on the
# speed of your VPS or Pi2 or Pi3, the process will be complete anywhere from 45 minutes to 4 hours.

# For Pi users. If you are using LynxCI, this script is already installed so simply powering on
# your Pi is enough to start the process. No further interaction is needed after flashing your Micro
# SD card with the latest version of LynxCI, plugging it into your Pi and powering it one. This
# script will support Pi 2 and 3 only please.
