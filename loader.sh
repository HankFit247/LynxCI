# This script will setup the host OS and install all dependencies. Some hosting vendors might
# require a manual reboot (i.e. HostBRZ) after the whole thing is complete. 

# "$ wget -O - https://explorer.getlynx.io/loader.sh | bash"
# or
# "$ wget -O - https://test-explorer.getlynx.io/loader.sh | bash"

# Alternatively, To execute a manual install, create a file in the /root dir as the root user on the 
# new VPS. Create a file called 'loader.sh' or 'loaderTest.sh', depending on the environment you 
# want ot build, mainet or testet respectively. After creatig the file, give it executable rights 
# with "chmod 744 loader*". Once that is done, you can begin the install by executing the file 
# ("./loader.sh" or "./loaderTest.sh"). This istallation will allow you to close the session widow 
# in your termial or putty window. The script will run in the background without need for human 
# interaction. Depending on the speed of your VPS or Pi2 or Pi3, the process will be complete 
# anywhere from 45 minutes to 4 hours.

# For Pi users. If you are using LynxCI, this script is already installed so simply powering on 
# your Pi is enough to start the process. No further interaction is needed after flashing your Micro
# SD card with the latest version of LynxCI, plugging it into your Pi and powering it one. This 
# script will support Pi 2 and 3 only please.
