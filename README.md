# [Lynx](https://getlynx.io) Cryptocurrency Installer (LynxCI)

Creates a Lynx cryptocurrency node that confirms and relays transactions, runs an eco-friendly built-in miner and also creates a local robust Block Explorer website including Lynx development news, real-time miner cost reporting, public API & RPC access points, and Lynx information.

## One line install script

This script supports the following Linux operating systems. [Raspbian for Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Debian 9 and Debian 8. The script is only recommended for a VPS or local server that has a freshly installed OS with no previously written data. Seriously, don't execute this script on a VPS that has data you care about. This precaution is for your own security.

You can execute the following install script, as 'root', after your OS is installed. Just copy/paste and hit return. 
```
wget -qO - https://getlynx.io/setup.sh | bash
```
The initial install only takes about 2 minutes (depending on the speed of your host), so keep your terminal open until it tells you it's done. The rest of the install will run in the background, so no need to stay logged in or keep the terminal window open after it tells you it's done. You can watch it build if you like. The full installation log is saved to /var/log/syslog.

After the LynxCI node is built, the default user account is 'lynx' and the password will be 'lynx'. Please change the password immediately. You won't be able to log in as 'root' (or 'pi'), as the installer locks those user accounts for security reasons. The 'lynx' user account does get sudo. The last step of the build is to reboot the host, so you will know it's done when your host or Pi reboots itself. Some VPS vendors don't reboot well, so check the status of your VPS after about 45 minutes to make sure it came back up. 

After the build finishes and the host reboots, you will have 18 hours to log in. This is a feature that results in a higher level of security for the host. Of course, the wallet functions of the host are not enabled by default too. If you can't log in with with the default password 'lynx', use the console feature of your VPS vendor (they all have it), access the root account and edit the 'IsRestricted' variable (change it from 'Y' to 'N') in the /root/firewall.sh file, and then execute the /root/firewall.sh file. Further details on this feature are available on our [Lynx FAQ](https://getlynx.io/faq/).

## [LynxCI for Pi](http://cdn.getlynx.io/LynxCI.tar.gz)

The above instructions work fine for a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 if you want to play, learn and do it manually. But if you want to get your Raspberry Pi up and running quick, the ISO is for you. Simply [download the LynxCI ISO from here](https://getlynx.io/downloads/) and then flash it to an SD card. We have found [Etcher](https://etcher.io) to be very easy to use. Then insert the card into the SD card slot on the bottom of the Raspberry Pi and power it on. No keyboard, mouse or monitor is required. You must plug in an ethernet cable connection to the device; maybe from your home router. That is it. It will be fully functional in about 15 hours. Here is a blog post and video of the [whole process](https://getlynx.io/can-non-techies-mine-lynx-crypto/).

## What is Lynx?

Lynx is a secure cryptocurrency with fast transaction speeds and low-transaction fees. It’s also eco-friendly & easy-to-use. In 2017, our team upgraded, fixed and rebranded Kittehcoin as Lynx. How? We successfully forked Litecoin and ported the Kittehcoin blockchain history to it. This gives Lynx all the benefits of Litecoin with the full transaction history of Kittehcoin. The upgrades fixed the flaws in the original coin and revived its community of users. It’s cryptocurrency from the past; redesigned for the future.

## How is Lynx an "eco-friendly cryptocurrency"?

You can read the Lynx whitepaper PDF at the [website](https://getlynx.io).

According to a recent article in [Wired magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/bitcoin-global-warming/);, “Bitcoin emits the equivalent of 17.7 million tons of carbon dioxide every year.” That’s a big problem! At Lynx, we believe that for cryptocurrency to be considered a secure, financial solution for today’s global marketplace, it must be created with global sustainability in mind. The energy costs of high-volume mining rigs are too demanding and they create an over-reliance on fossil fuels. Lynx code discourages high-volume mining rigs because our code purposefully lacks incentives to mine it for profit. Here are some of the business rules that help us achieve this goal:

1. The mining reward takes one week to “mature.”

2. The individual mining reward is only 1 Lynx (+ fees).

3. The cost of a transaction is 0.0001 Lynx/kb.

4. Proof of Work was modified to better secure against a 51% attack.

Lynx is a cryptocurrency from the past re-designed for the future. We designed Lynx to have minimal environmental impact because we’re committed to creating global solutions and maintaining a small carbon footprint. Lynx business rules encourage the use of low-cost computing (like a Raspberry Pi which only consumes less than 3 watts of electricity) to mine the coin. As a result, the electrical cost to maintain the Lynx network is a fraction of a fraction which results in a low environmental impact. The emphasis on low-cost computing also creates a decentralized, broad miner base which also strengthens the stability and security of the currency.

## Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Note

Package install will fail during the initial step if you don't upgrade the kernel first, then reboot. If you don't know how to do this, please consult the [Lynx FAQ](https://getlynx.io/faq/).
